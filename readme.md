# Assignment 5

## _Minimum vertex cover_

To run this assignment the first requiremnt is that python should be installed in the local machine. There are two main algortihms written for minimum vertex cover one is a bruteforce algortihm and the other is an approximation algorithm.

The bruteforce algorithm is written in `bf_vertext_cover.py` and the approximation algorithm is written in `ap_vertex_cover.py`.

To run the `bf_vertex_cover.py` simply type

```sh
python3 bf_vertex_cover.py
```

To run the `ap_vertex_cover.py` simply type

```sh
python3 ap_vertex_cover.py
```

All the results of these algorithms will be shown in the terminal.

The idea of this algorithm was taken from the following repos
